# Immediate thoughts after this

* I lectured too much
* There's at least an hour too much material
* The subplots example was at least three things too much
* Make more teaching points in the middle to break it up - they kept slipping my mind
* The module re-import problem on the UDE machines is really frustrating
* In plotting the subplots example introduced too much load in one go
* Need to find a less lecture-y way of intro-ing the testing part
* Sticky notes don't stick on UDE monitors very well. :(
* Maybe skip tuples and dictionaries completely. Just talk about lists and numpy.
